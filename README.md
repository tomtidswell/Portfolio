## Pacman - The classic arcade game built in JavaScript.

> JavaScript

My first attempt at a game with complex logic. The ghosts all think independently, and have different strategy for getting to pacman. To top it off, it has a gloriously retro 80s vibe.

## Rock, paper, scissors - Even more fun with lizard and spock too.

Either play the computer, or watch the computer play its self. I used this game as an opportunity to try out some 3D transitions to immerse the player into the game.
